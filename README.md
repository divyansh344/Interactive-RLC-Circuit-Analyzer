# Matlab-Circuit-Simulation
I've made a RLC circuit simulator which takes values of circuit parameters from user and shows the output (rms values and waveforms) based on that
1) first open the user input app and input the values and click on submit button and then open the circuit simulation app 
2) For circuit simulation choose the stop time and click on the Run button to observe the output
