# Matlab-Circuit-Simulation
I've made a RLC circuit simulator which takes values of circuit parameters from user and shows the output (rms values and waveforms) based on that
 For user input click on Run button to apply the changes
For circuit simulation choose the stop time and click on the Run button to observe the output
