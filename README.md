# Matlab-Circuit-Simulation
I've made a RLC circuit simulator which takes values of circuit parameters from user and shows the output (rms values and waveforms) based on that: 
1)For user input click on Run button to apply the changes,
2)For circuit simulation choose the stop time and click on the Run button to observe the output
